## Abridged Ruleset

With each pass, both knights will roll their attacks. You roll a six-sided die: three (3) and below fails, four (4) and above succeeds. A successful roll will lead to subsequent chances to roll, for a total of four potential actions:
1) The knight hits or misses their strike
2) The hit shatters the attacker's lance or not (scoring a point)
3) The lance-shattering hit hurts the opposing knight or not
4) The opposing knight remaining in their saddle or falls

The joust commences for three rounds. Unless one of our knights is unhorsed or too injured to continue, the knight with the most broken lances wins. If there is no victor, rounds continue in sudden death until the joust is resolved.

__*Our prototype combatants are Guy de Lafayette and The Black Knight. Behold their struggle as they clash in thrilling single combat!*__
